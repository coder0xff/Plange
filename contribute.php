		<h2>Short & Simple</h2>
		<p>Study the examples around the site. There are a lot of them hidden away in the pages. If you see anything that looks fishy, contradictory, inconsistent, etc with other documentation please send me a message.

		<h2>Deeper contributions</h2>
		<p>Plange is an ambitious computer science and engineering project, still in the earliest stages. As an open source and public effort, participation is enthusiastically encouraged. Contributions from any and all skill levels are necessary and <i>enthusiatically</i> encouraged. There should be enough of the site already filled in to help you get a feelfor the project, and you can go from there.</p>

		</p>Please send any comments, critique, or questions to coder0xff on the gmail domain. @coder0xff on twitter.</p>

		<h2>Status</h2>
		<p>Most of the work so far has been in design of the language and toolchain, including the documentation on this site. The current focus is formalization of the grammar. To help this process, the Examples page could have a lot more content. Once familiar, try writing some programs and send them my way. There is no interpreter yet, so it's up to you to get acquainted with the conventions.</p>
