		<h2>Welcome!</h2>
		If you're looking to contribute to open source, allow me to offer a project for your consideration. It's called Plange. It began in August 2013 as an effort to create a revolutionary development experience, including a programming language with some exciting new ideas. There is still plenty of work to be done, suitable for any and all skill levels. Please peruse this website, which is the dedicated source of information and webservices for the project. Thanks for your time!
