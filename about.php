        <p>This project began in 2013. My experience in the software development
        ecosystem the two decades prior led me to this conclusion: there is much
        left to be desired in the power and flexibility of modern programming
        languages and tools.</p>
        <p>Plange began as a bulleted list of features and ideas. Existing
        languages were used as inspiration for this list - their successes and
        also their failings. This approach has lead to a language with a very
        large scope. Though ambitious, I hope to make a meaningful contribution
        to the comparatively infantile domains of computer science and software
        engineering.</p>
        <p>The name is a reference to the 4th episode of the series "IT Crowd".
