			Plange (plaːnd͡ʒ) is a project to create a revolutionary
			development environment, including a programming language,
			standard library, and runtime.
		</div>
		<p>
		This site is far from complete, but the <a href="goals/">Goals</a>
			page has a good amount of information that you may find interesting. Use the
			navigation bar to the left to browse the site. The <a href="documentation">Documentation</a>
			pages are the technical
			specifications and reference materials.</p>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Plange began as a list of features and ideas. Existing
			languages were used as inspiration for this list - their
			successes and also their failings.</p>
		<p>Creating a language that
			picks and chooses the best features of many successful
			languages, integrates them, and has an expansive and robust
			runtime and standard library is an ambitious undertaking.
			Nonetheless, this is the goal for Plange.</p>
		<p>A recurring trend in programming language development has
			been to focus on a small set of problems that other languages
			don’t currently address well, and design the language, its
			runtime, and its standard library with those few goals in mind.
			This drives not only the noticeable differences in syntax, but
			often different features in the standard library of the
			language, and in features of the language itself. Some examples:</p>
		<ul>
				<li>C# makes object lifetime management a non issue, but
					precludes any possibility of cooperative multithreading.</li>
				<li>Perl is a scripting language that’s great at string
					manipulation, but isn’t suitable for low level systems
					programming.</li>
				<li>Cuda is a powerful parallel processing tool, but isn’t
					practical for database access.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>C++ and Java are excellent general purpose languages, but have
			begun to show their age. Features are added, but they will
			forever remain in the same generation of languages to which they
			were born.</p>
		<p>Most languages’ capabilities can be expanded through creating
			new libraries, or even inter-operating with libraries written in
			other languages. For many common cases, however, this approach
			lacks the straight forward integration that one might find by
			working in another language. As a result, fragmentation of the
			global software ecosystem runs deep. From a practical
			standpoint, developers eventually discover the limits of their
			chosen development language, and find themselves locked in, or
			forced to use an additional language. They may migrate entirely
			(or in rare cases fix it themselves). Plange represents an
			effort to aggregate current technologies into an accessible yet
			powerful package, while anticipating its own incompleteness.</p>
		<h2>Hello World</h2>
		<p>It is traditional to start with the "Hello world" program:</p>
		<div class="code">
				<pre>print("Hello, world!");</pre>
		</div>
		<p>Statements are terminated by a semicolon. Comments are
				created using two syntactic variations:</p>
		<div class="code">
				<p>End of line comment (red is comment text)</p>
				<pre>print("My name is HAL 9000."); <font color="#ff0000">//only kidding!</font></pre>
		</div>
		<div class="code">
				<p>Inline comment (red is comment text) <small><small><small><a href="https://www.xkcd.com/221/">source</a></small></small></small></p>
				<pre>getRandomNumber := { return 4; <font color="#ff0000">/*choosen by fair dice roll*/</font> }; <font color="#ff0000">//guaranteed to be random</font></pre>
		</div>
		<h2>Constants and Variables</h2>
		<p>When a value is given a symbol to identify it, that symbol
			is a constant.
		</p>
		<div class="code">
				<p>Example</p>
				<pre>print(π); //print pi</pre>
		</div>
		<p>The symbol <code>π</code> is an identifier for the pi
			constant. It can be substituted in places where pi is needed, and
			provides arbitrarily high precision.</p>
		
		<p><span style="color: red">IMPORTANT!</span> As you've probably noticed, there's no π key on your keyboard. The plange editor will change <code>" pi "</code> (must have the spaces, but not the quotes) into π. It's just a <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/03c0/index.htm">UTF character</a>. If your editor of choice doesn't auto-replace " pi ", that's ok too. The interpreter will know what you mean if you just write "pi".</p>
		<p>Constants are created using the definition operator <code>:=</code></p>
		<div class="code">
				<p>Example</p>
				<pre>daysInAWeek := 7;</pre>
		</div>
		<p>Variables are symbols which hold a value that can change.</p>
		<div class="code">
				<p>Example</p>
				<pre>color ← "Blue";
print(color);
color ← "Red";
print(color);</pre>
		</div>
		<p>The ← character is typed <code>" <- "</code>. The above program outputs the following text:</p>
		<div class="code">
				<p>Output</p>
				<pre>Blue
Red</pre>
		</div>
		<h2>Types</h2>
		<p>Constants and variables can be constrained to a specific type.</p>
		<div class="code">
				<p>Example</p>
				<pre>&lt;Int&gt; x ← 10;
x ← 1.5; // error - can't assign a fractional Number to an integer</pre>
		</div>
		<p>
				See <a href="documentation/using-types.php">Type System</a>.</p>
		<h3>Functions</h3>
		<p>Create function types using the → operator, or <code>-&gt;</code>.
			Create function implementations using parenthesis <code>( )</code>
			containing the parameter list, followed by curly braces <code>{ }</code>
			containing the implementation.</p>
		<div class="code">
				<p>Example</p>
				<pre>&lt;Int → Int&gt; doubler := (&lt;Int&gt; x) { return x * 2; };
print(doubler(5));</pre>
		</div>
		<div class="code">
				<p>Output</p>
				<pre>10</pre>
		</div>
		<p>Functions can have more than one parameter.</p>
		<div class="code">
				<p>Example</p>
				<pre>&lt;Real * Real → Real&gt; geometric_mean := (&lt;Real&gt; x, &lt;Real&gt; y) { return (x * y)^(0.5); };</pre>
		</div>
		<h3>Pattern Matching</h3>
		<p>From functional programming, a recursive function to print
		the last element of a list:</p>
		<div class="code">
				<p>Example</p>
				<pre>&lt;List&lt;_&gt; → Void&gt; printLast := 
	(_:tail) { printLast(tail); } |
	(x) { print(x); };

myList := [ 5, 12, 8, 9 ];
printLast(myList);</pre>
		</div>
		<div class="code">
				<p>Output</p>
				<pre>9</pre>
		</div>
		Note the use of the underscore <code>_</code> character. It is
			substituted for a symbol (a named constant) when the code does not
			care about its value. In the first line of the example above, we
			are unconcerned with the type of the elements the input list
			contains, and only need to ensure that the input is a list of
			something. In the second line, we don't need to know the value of
			the head element. The underscore keyword is called
				<a href="documentation/keywords/dont_care.php">dont_care</a>.
		<h3>Type Deduction</h3>
		<p>
				When the type of a constant or variable can be deduced, it
is often possible to omit it.
		</p>
		<div class="code">
				<p>Example</p>
				<pre>&lt;&gt; name := "Snippet"; // name is deduced to be a String</pre>
		</div>
		<p>
				Modifying a previous example:
		</p>
		<div class="code">
				<p>Example</p>
				<pre>&lt;&gt; doubler := (x) { return x * 2; };
print(doubler(5));</pre>
		</div>
		<p>In definitions of constants, and declarations and
			assignments of variables, the angle brackets &lt; &gt; may be
			omitted entirely.</p>
		<div class="code">
				<p>Example</p>
				<pre>doubler := (x) { return x * 2; };
print(doubler(5));</pre>
		</div>
		<p>Type deduction is not limited to only simple cases.</p>
		<div class="code">
				<p>Demonstration of more complex type deduction via pattern matching</p>
				<pre>get_return_type := ( &lt;_ → x&gt; func ) { return x; };
addFive := (&lt;Int&gt; x) { return x + 5; };
print(get_return_type(addFive));  // output: Int</pre>
		</div>
		<h2>Types</h2>
		<p>
				The <a href="/documentation/keywords/type.php"><code>type</code></a>
				(not capitalized) keyword is used to make a new
				<a href="/documentation/standard-library/type.php"><code>Type</code></a>
				(capitalized) object.
		</p>
		<div class="code">
				<p>Example</p>
				<pre>Color := type {
	&lt;Double&gt; r;
	&lt;Double&gt; g;
	&lt;Double&gt; b;
};

&lt;Color&gt; red ← (1, 0, 0);

print(type_of( (1, 0, 0) ));  // output: Tuple&lt;Number, Number, Number&gt;
print(type_of(red));          // output: Color
print(type_of(Color));        // output: Type</pre>
		</div>
		<h3>Type Functions</h3>
		<p>Type functions, or parametric types are functions that return Type objects.</p>
		<div class="code">
				<p>Example</p>
				<pre>Node := (&lt;Type&gt; valueType) {
	return type {
		&lt;valueType&gt; v;
		Pointer&lt;Node&gt; next;
	};
}</pre>
		</div>
		<p>Functions that return Type objects can be called with the
			angle bracket syntax:</p>
		<div class="code">
				<p>Example</p>
				<pre>&lt;Node&lt;Int&gt;&gt; myNode;</pre>
		</div>
		<h3>Polymorphism</h3>
		<p>The <a href="documentation/keywords/inheriting.php">inheriting</a>
			keyword, used in conjunction with the type
			keyword, makes a new Type object that inherits the members of
			the specified base Types. See also:
				<a href="documentation/keywords/implementing.php">implementing</a></p>
		<div class="code">
				<p>Example</p>
				<pre>// base Type
Widget := type {
	&lt;Void → Image&gt; Paint;
};

// derived Type
TextBox := type inheriting Widget {
	&lt;String&gt; text ← "Hello, world!";

	// override the inherited Paint method
	Paint ← {
		return Drawing.Render(text)
	};
};</pre>
		</div>
		<h3>Algebraic Types</h3>
		<p>Types can be combined together to make algebraic Types using the |
			operator.</p>
		<div class="code">
				<p>
						Example
				</p>
				<pre>Some := (t) { return type { &lt;t&gt; value; } };
None := type {};
Maybe := (t) { return Some&lt;t&gt; | None; };

&lt;Void → Maybe&lt;Int&gt;&gt; get_age := {
	return coerce(input("What's your age? You don't have to tell me."));
}

print(get_age);</pre>
		</div>

		<h3>Constraint solving</h3>
		<p>Many interesting problems may be constructed as one or more assertions regarding the relationships of values, using operators (arithmetic, set theoric, quantifiers, etc), and invocations such as calling the sin() function. One well studied domain is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_value_problem">initial value problems</a>.

		<div class="code">
			<p>Example</p>
			<pre>projectilePosition := (Vector3 pos, Vector3 vel, Vector3 thrust, Double mass, Double drag, Vector3 gravity, Double t) {
	mass * p''(t) = -drag * p'(t) + mass * gravity;
	p(0) = pos;
	p'(0) = vel;
	return p(t); //p(t) symbollically integrated to closed form solution
}</pre>
		</div>

		<div class="code">
			<p>Example (continued)</p>
			<pre>projectilePosition := (Vector3 pos, Vector3 vel, Vector3 thrust, Double mass, Double drag, Vector3 gravity, Double t) {
	a := 𝑒^(drag*t/mass);
	return (gravity * (mass-(mass*a + drag*t)) + pos*a*drag^2 + drag*mass*vel*(a-1)) / (a*drag^2);
}</pre>
		</div>
