    A property is a symbol representing a relation or get and set accessors defined in another execution context. A purely functional Property has no get or set accessors, but is defined using an expression. There are also imperative properties with explicitly implemented accessors.  Semantically, the defining Scope becomes accessible by the 
caller (the code accessing the value), but only through code provided by
 that Scope.
