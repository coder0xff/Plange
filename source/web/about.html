        Plange began as a bulleted list of features and ideas. Existing 
languages were used as inspiration for this list - their successes and 
also their failings. This approach has lead to a language with a very large scope. Though ambitious, I hope to make a meaningful contribution to the comparatively infantile domains of computer science and software engineering.
