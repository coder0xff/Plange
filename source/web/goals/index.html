    The fundamental challenge:
    <div><big><big><big>Create a development environment that permits
            the developer to do whatever they may conceive of.</big></big></big></div>
    Plange may not accomplish a developers goals for them, but it
    strives to stay out of the way while maintaining its usefulness. In
    other words: do not obstruct any use case, and anticipate many of
    them. As the developer explores the languages capabilities, they
    discover new potential domains rather than boundaries. A small
    number of specific goals stem from this notion, and provide an
    outline for the project.
    <h2>Strongly-Connected Model of Computation</h2>
    A key concept for maximizing power and flexibility, and proof that
    plange does not obstruct any use case. See the <a

    <h2>Solver and C.A.S.</h2>
    <p>The interface to the solver and computer algebra system is
      through syntax and semantics built into the language. Constraints
      on systems, in the form of expressions in predicate logic,
      differentials, and other problem domains are solved symbolically,
      or numeric methods are used at runtime. This is achieved through
      the integration of <a
        href="../../../external.html?link=http://www.sagemath.org/"
        rel="nofollow">SageMath</a> and SAT solving into the tool chain.</p>
    <h2>Scripting friendly</h2>
    <div> Ensure that simple solutions exist for simple problems. The
      "Hello World" program must be one line of source code, one
      statement. As such, functions for printing, manipulating files,
      and other basic operations are automatically in scope of each
      translation unit. See: <a
        href="../documentation/standard-library.html"> Standard Library
      </a> &nbsp;Further, the bar to entry must be low for provisioning
      and for typical use. Accessibility is critical to good adoption. </div>
    <h2>Bare Metal</h2>
    <div>
      <p> The highest level languages create an abstraction of the
        physical hardware that's dramatically different from the
        reality. This approach is very powerful. But as with all things,
        it is not the optimal solution for all problems. For high level
        abstractions, developers often (and sometimes unwittingly)
        exchange the ability to reach the "bare metal." Instead, a well
        rounded language maintains the accessibility of the system
        hardware as a semantic feature of the language. The most obvious
        approach is to provide first-class inline assembler support.
        See: <a href="../documentation/keywords/asm.html">asm</a> </p>
      <h2>Comprehensive Libraries</h2>
      <p>A standard library that is broad, compared to python, or .Net.
        An official website catalogs the standard library, and provides
        a moderated platform for open-source user contributions.</p>
      <h2>Communicate Well</h2>
      <p>Documentation is exhaustive, generated wherever possible, and
        available whenever possible. This website serves as the primary
        source for structured and unstructured information used in the
        building of the tool chain. For example, the Syntax pages (under
        Documentation) of this website are used by a web scraper to
        generate grammar files plange. Formalism in documentation and
        source code is highly valued.</p>
      <p>Error message, diagnostics, etc. should be helpful. e.g. Think
        of clang's template error messages versus gcc's.</p>
